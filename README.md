# Verification_Projects
Pulse Width Modulation (Stepper motor controller verification) PWM

  •	Designed a UVM TB environment along with constrained random sequences for various bridge Modes with different alignments for NXP SAC57D54H specification

  •	Developed a reference model, register structure with monitors, checkers, and scoreboards targeting formal verification, coverage-driven verification. 

UART Verification

•	Understood the UART Communication protocol and planned the Verification Architecture with focus on coverage 

•	UVM Based verification with features like full duplex, loopback, Break, Framing and Parity error with coverage-driven verification and regression 

•	Wrote a shell script to regressively test DUT’s with reports, also focus on improving test cases to hit 100% coverage

ALU Verifiaction

•	Developed a UVM TB with constrained sequences and verified result with Scoreboard using System Verilog On ten encrypted ALU DUT(s), automated the testing with the script and       performed code/functional coverages
